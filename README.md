## Code

* Code: [link](https://github.com/TanapolHongsuwan/LED-with-Raspberri-Pi/blob/main/myled.c)
* Makefile: [link](https://github.com/TanapolHongsuwan/LED-with-Raspberri-Pi/blob/main/Makefile)

### Requirements

The code will works with the requirements below.

  * Ubuntu native/Ubuntu on WSL
  * Raspberri Pi 3 above
  * LED x 3
  * 300Î© of resistor x 3
  * Female to male jumper wire x 4
  * Breadboard
  
### Circuit

The Figure below is representing how to setup the circuit for this project.


### Build

1. First of all, clone this repository with the following command.

       $ git clone https://github.com/TanapolHongsuwan/LED-RaspPi-DeviceDrivers.git
       
       $ cd LED-RaspPi-DeviceDrivers
  
2. In the folder, type "make" and if there is no target mentioned at the beginning (or old), the process of that target will run.

       $ make
  
3. Install the modules.

       $ sudo insmod myled.ko
  
* In case, to erase the old module and kernel module in order to make (compile) the new one.
    
       $ sudo rmmod myled
       
       $ make clean
  
4. Change the permissions on the resulting  /dev/myled0

       $ sudo chmod 666 /dev/myled0
  
### Run

There are 4 patterns for running LED in this program.

1. Only red LED

       $ sudo 1 > /dev/myled0
  
2. Only green LED

       $ sudo 2 > /dev/myled0
  
3. Only white LED

       $ sudo 3 > /dev/myled0
  
4. LEDs show

       $ sudo 4 > /dev/myled0
  
5. To turn off all the LEDs.

       $ sudo 0 > /dev/myled0
  
## About the Project

This is my first project with Raspberry Pi based on Prof. Ryuichi Ueda's template code, learning about device driver by Raspberry Pi and LED on Ubuntu. I've written this in English because I wish I could use this repository to share knowledge with not only Japanese, but all programmers around the world somedays in the future.
