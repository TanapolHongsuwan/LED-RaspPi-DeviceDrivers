### Requirements

The code will works with the requirements below.

  * Ubuntu native/Ubuntu on WSL
  * Raspberri Pi 3 above
  * LED x 3
  * 300Î© of resistor x 3
  * Female to male jumper wire x 4
  * Breadboard
  
### Circuit

The Figure below is representing how to setup the circuit for this project.


### Build

1. Open a Raspberry Pi on Ubuntu native (or WSL) and  Makefile in the folder that you want to save by using vim (optional).

  $ vi Makefile
  
2. Make a new .c file by using vim (optional) and save the code. Based on Makefile, the name of the file is "myled.c"

  $ vi myled.c
  
3. Type "make" and if there is no target mentioned at the beginning (or old), the process of that target will run.

  $ make
  
4. Install the modules.

  $ sudo insmod myled.ko
  
    * In case, to erase the old module and kernel module in order to make (compile) the new one.
    
  $ sudo rmmod myled
  $ make clean
  
5. Change the permissions on the resulting  /dev/myled0

  $ sudo chmod 666 /dev/myled0
  
### Run

There are 4 patterns for running LED in this program.

1. Only red LED

  $ sudo 1 > /dev/myled0
  
2. Only green LED

  $ sudo 2 > /dev/myled0
  
3. Only white LED

  $ sudo 3 > /dev/myled0
  
4. LEDs show

  $ sudo 4 > /dev/myled0
  
5. To turn off all the LEDs.

  $ sudo 0 > /dev/myled0
